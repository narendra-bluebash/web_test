    "  Admin Dashboard-  This serves as the central control panel for the application, enabling administrators to oversee all aspects, including instructors, students, lessons (or lesson series), and make necessary adjustments. From this dashboard, we can also handle the billing for the lessons(including adjustments), make custom changes for prices for lessons, handle payouts for instructors, and view the stats and logs for students, instructors, and even marketplace performance for the instructors. Additionally, functions such as managing Referral Links and analyzing Instructor marketplace performance are handled here.\n      ",
    " Instructor Dashboard-   Every instructor on Tunelark has access to their personalized dashboard, where they can manage lessons, define teaching schedules, enable/disable trial lessons, create and manage assignments, and share files with students if relevant. It serves as a comprehensive workspace for instructors to handle their tasks efficiently.\n      ",
    " Student Dashboard-  Students are provided with their own dashboard to manage lessons, lesson requests, payments, and book lessons with existing or new instructors based on the availability shown on the calendar. Aside from the regular lectures, we have also added interactive games that align with the learning process for the students so that they can learn as they play, making learning more fun. They can also manage managed accounts under them and reach out to the support team if needed, all from one centralized platform.\n      ",
    "  Instructor Marketplace Page-\n         Also known as Teacher Marketplace, it is a key feature of our application as this page lists all available instructors in the marketplace.
